# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Description

As a student learning how to code, it is important to learn how to refactor a code that is presented without changing what the code does and leave the code cleaner than how it was left. The goal of this is to make it more accessible for users so that the website will be optimized for search engines. We need to make sure all of the links work properly, the HTML elements is logically structured, and they fall in sequential order. It is imperative that if another user were to access this code, they are able to understand and read the code easily.

## Installation

## Usage

The Horiseon website can be used by clicking on the links in the header section at the top right to lead the user to certain images on the page. Each image contains captions explaining important topics on how to improve a business by being more accessible. Each link has a title that easily brings the user to the corresponding image.
